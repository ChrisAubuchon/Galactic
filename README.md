# A Galactic Experience

```
  'A Galactic Experience' is the second in a series of games by the Creator! It is strongly recommended that you play the original 'Adventure' and 'A Remarkable Experience' before attempting this game.
  You start your adventure in Earth's spaceport, located next to a small Earth town.  Most of Earth is now a radioactive wasteland.  You are the captain of the space ship - Surge, which is a small merchant ship.  You are searching for fame and fortune among the stars, but unknown to most, you are also a member of the Galactic Reserve and you should conduct yourself accordingly.
  If you want extra information type 'HELP'.
           Happy Adventuring!

  *Galactic* is a text adventure/interactive fiction that I played with my father on a 
Heathkit H89. It was the second IF game that I ever played and remains one of the two 
IF games that I seriously played and never completed. After disassembling the original Z80
binary, I can confidently state that I would never have been able to solve it.

  I intend to "port" the original code into other languages. This is mainly as language
practice for me. There is (more than) a hint of sadism in making this game more accessible.
Maybe, just maybe, somebody will try to beat the game and suffer the entire time.

  In the `original/` directory, you will find the disassembly of the original Z80 code. I have tried to split the original code into individual files to make it easier to understand.

# Happy Adventuring!
