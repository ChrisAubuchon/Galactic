	Welcome to 'A Galactic Experience'!
	Would you like instructions?

0x0050:

	'A Galactic Experience' is the second in a series of games by the
Creator!  It is strongly recommended that you play the original 'Adventure'
and 'A Remarkable Experience' before attempting this game.
	You start your adventure in Earth's spaceport, located next to a
small Earth town.  Most of Earth is now a radioactive wasteland.  You are
the captain of the space ship - Surge, which is a small merchant ship.
You are searching for fame and fortune among the stars, but unknown to
most, you are also a member of the Galactic Reserve and you should conduct
yourself accordingly.
	If you want extra information type 'HELP'.
			Happy Adventuring!

0x028e:

	As always, sentences are limited to two words, but now I look at the
first five letters of each word.  Even so, you'll still have to enter
'NORTHWEST' as 'NW', 'CLOCKWISE' as 'CW', etc.  One word commands work most
of the time.  If I need clarification, I will ask for it.  Generally, I
know of directions, actions, and things.
	The object of this game is to obtain points.  You receive
points for various activities, just as in the other adventure games.  This
is not primarily a 'find and return treasure - adventure game'.  You
mainly get points for solving problems and carrying out the mission you
will receive.
	You can save your current game by typing 'SAVE'.
	You can find out how well you are doing by typing 'SCORE'.
	You can end your adventure early by saying 'QUIT'.
	It is generally a good idea to check in with the local commander
whenever you hit planet.
	Caution and compassion are recommended when dealing with other
intelligent beings.
			Good Luck!

	Captain, the two 8" CP/M planetary control disks for the planet
Isthur have been stolen and all backups destroyed.  They've managed to rig
up temporary air control, but Isthur is running on battery reserve power
and is literally being buried under its own garbage.  I have reactivated
your Galactic Reserve status and I want you to get out to Isthur, recover
those disks, and get them back in operation.  The urgency is not only for
Isthur.  One of our officers, going under the guise of a computer technician,
was working on a top secret formula on Isthur and he was murdered during the
the theft.  We must know what progress he made.  His computer password was
			ANALOG57.
	I have set up unlimited credits in your name.  So get what you'll
need and don't miss blastoff.
		Good Luck!

0x1df4:

	Isthur:  Coordinates: x = -12, y = -17, z = 0
		This is a small planet with no atmosphere.  Installation
	Gamma is the only settlement.  This settlement is more commonly
	referred to as the Bubbles of Isthur.  Installation Gamma has
	only recently shifted its Environmental System to complete
	Computer Control.

0x1f0c:

	Navier:  Coordinates: x = 13, y = -12, z = 73
		This is frequently referred to as the Planet of Puzzles.
	Long ago a small group of Game Theorists broke off from the main
	colony and formed the Underground of Navier.  There is only a
	small group of the original colonists remaining, for all are
	scared to enter the underground.  This portion of the colony is
	referred to by the remaining colonists as the City of Illusions.

0x2086:

	Solomaw:  Coordinates: x = 56, y = 11, z = -80
		This planet is referred to as the Planet of Wisdom.  The
	High Priest of Solomaw is reported to have knowledge and wisdom
	almost beyond belief.  However, all that have gone to this planet
	in search of answers to problems they could not solve, have been
	made to pass a series of tests to prove themselves worthy.  To
	our knowledge, no outsider has ever returned from the planet
	Solomaw.

back on line in the next few weeks, we'll be buried in our own garbage.  I
sincerely hope that you'll be able to help us.

0x3b0c:

	Captain, I'm glad you've returned.  I've just learned that the crook
must be on his way to Grand Central Space Station.  We've radioed ahead and
you'll be using the code name 'PLAYER' to check in.  A Control Tower
technician has found the coordinates for Grand Central Space Station.  They
are:  x = 5, y = 10, z = 5.  Your cover will be observed on Grand Central
and they will give you every assistance.  I have taken the liberty of

0x47ae:

	Captain, I have just heard the terrible news.  I have heard rumors
that there is a planet where the people are extremely wise.  I wonder if
they could tell us how to fix the partially destroyed disks.  I don't
know the name of the planet, but I do know it exists.

0x489c:

	Captain, I thank you for the wonderful job that you have done.  I
know that you are eager to return to Earth, so I won't keep you.  Your
ship is refueled and your supplies have been taken care of.  If I can ever
be of assistance in the future, let me know.

	You are in your ship again.

0x57de:

	You are in your ship which is parked in the landing bay at Grand
Central Space Station.

0x5832:

	There is a P-suit near the door.

0x5855:

	You are not carrying a P-suit.

0x5878:

	You are wearing a P-suit.

0x5894:

	Your ship is not cleared for lifting.  A security guard is posted
outside your door.

0x58e1:

	You are in the Landing Bay.  An armed security quard places you
under arrest.  He handcuffs you and escorts you to Headquarters.

0x5958:

	You consume all the ship's beverages and are quite tipsy.

0x5990:

	You rest for an hour and awake from a terrible nightmare.

0x59c8:

	You are unable to do that now.

0x59eb:

	The USS Surge is cleared for takeoff.  Lift is in 10 seconds.
Please secure your harness.

0x5a3f:

	You did not supervise the re-fueling of your ship and the tanks now
read empty.  Your ship has become an orbiting tomb around Alpha Centuri.

0x5abd:

	You are in the Landing Bay.

0x5ad9:

	You are in the Landing Bay of Grand Central Space Station.  The
passage toward the hub proceeds inward.  Your ship is parked here.
Another ship is docked and under repair.

0x5b73:

	Your ship appears to be in fine condition and refueling has begun.
Work on the other ship is nearing completion.  The maintenance crew advises
you that only one more part is needed to make it space ready.  That part is
being constructed in engineering.

0x5c53:

	OK.  The tanks are filled.

0x5c6f:

	OK!  Refueling your ship has begun.

0x5c92:

	The supplies are not stored here.

0x5cb5:

	Lucky for you, the landing bay doors were closed.  You have been
frozen solid by the sub-zero temperature in the Landing Bay during a metal
stress test.  Efforts to revive you are being made by the maintenance
crew.

0x5d79:

	You are unable to travel in your present condition.

0x5daa:

	You are in the landing bay - frozen solid.

0x5dd4:

	Re-heating your body is successful but since you were not prepared
for quick freezing, you suffer neural damage.

0x5e3d:

	The Landing Bay doors were open.  You are explosively decomposed by
the vacuum of space.  Efforts to revive you would be too messy to discuss.

0x5ec2:

	You are in the passageway, near a CRT terminal.

Landing Bay.

	Identification check completed.  Captain Player, the Commandant
wishes to see you before you lift off.  He requests your immediate return 
to Headquarters on a matter of vital urgency.

0x6409:

	You are in the outer airlock.

	You are in an outer airlock which connects the passageway and the 
inner airlock.  Both doors are closed.  A sign flashes above the inner
door.  There is a warning on the outer door.

Space Station or the outer airlock.  There is a bulletin board here.

0x65de:

	If you are traveling inward you may remove your P-suit.

	If you are traveling outward you should put on your P-suit.

	You catch a brief glimpse of a robot through the frosted

0x73d0:

	You are in Headquarters.

0x73ec:

	You are in the Headquarters of Grand Central Space Station.

0x7424:

	The Commandant is not in.

0x7440:

	The Commandant is in conference and cannot be disturbed.

0x7478:

	You have been arrested and brought to Headquarters.

0x74a9:

	The Commandant is looking perturbed at you with an obvious lecture 
on the tip of his tongue.

0x7504:

	You are still under guard and not allowed to leave.

0x7535:

	Captain Player, after all you have been through on this dangerous
mission, it is understandable that you could forget your computer access 
codes.  Your new user identification number:  
0x75dd:

	Your password is still ZEBRA.
	But now, see here, we have too much to do to run special retinal
identity checks, so don't let this happen again."

0x7662:

	Commandant Perry will see you now.  In fact, he has important 
information for you.

0x76af:

	"Captain Player, the dead woman has been identified as Lorayne Davies,
the computer systems analyst and operations research expert from Isthur.
We are unable to locate her sister, because she abandoned her key (#548)
backstage in the bar.  Security is on full alert.  Everyone is edgy.  We
are also attempting to apprehend Lucinda's manager, Ron Hershey, the talent
agent.  Be on the lookout for either, but do not attempt capture, as they
are believed to be armed.  Contact security if you see them."

0x786f:

	You are in Headquarters, having been arrested for attempted unauthorized
Computer Center entry.  You have been questioned, and a complete identification
check has been run.  You are being released with a grave warning from the 
Administrative Assistant.

0x7956:

	"Player, don't mess around the Computer Center.  You have not been
authorized entry and will not be authorized entry if I have any say about it.
I don't know what you think you want there, but this station will not have
any shenanigans with its computer programs.  Stay away from the Computer
Center."

0x7a67:

	Only the Commandant can do that.

0x7a8a:

	"Captain Player, I know you are eager to be on your way.  Verbal
command only requires that I tell you this new information in person.
First, you are probably concerned and would like to know that the Professor
has been hospitalized and is under treatment.  Prognosis is guarded, but he
is responding.  The doctor is broken-hearted, but functioning.  His career
has always been his life, yet his discovery of the twins momentarily opened
a door he thought was closed, only to have it slammed again.  He has poured
his energy into helping the Professor recover and that effort may be his
own salvation.  
	Most importantly, the Wonderlust has lifted off.  We believe the
singer and the talent agent coerced the pilot to help them escape.  From
their vector and angle, it seems their destination could be Navier."

0x7d54:

	You are in Engineering.

0x7d70:

	You are in Engineering.  It is a bee hive of activity with a major
inventory control examination obviously in process, as well as many repairs
in progress.

0x7dfc:

	The chief engineer is grumbling and in a very aggitated state.

0x7e3b:

	"Oh, yes, Captain Player, your ship inspection is completed...
That report is here somewhere.  Just a moment.  Although, I don't see
how we've gotten any work done.  What with security disrupting us con-
stantly and those two hoodlums whisking off Captain Goode, threatening my
staff, stealing that engine part -- I don't know how I'll account for that.
HQ is screaming about cost overruns as it is.  Speaking of screaming, those 
three may never get off station, the way they were quarreling.  For example,
that pretty blond dropped her brief case (the handle seemed to be broken
and the catch busted), but I thought that Hershey fellow was going to blast
her for being clumsy.  Then, too, I never heard anyone argue like Goode did
with a blaster in his back.  Oh, yes, here's your report.  Your ship is in
A-1 shape, no repairs, standard inspection, routine fee.  You're logged
mechanically clear to lift off at your convenience.

0x816e:

	You're in the hospital.

0x818a:

	The hospital is a typical space station, emergency-care medical
facility.  There is an advanced life support system and extensive medical
equipment here.

0x8216:

	You're in the hospital having just received emergency treatment for 
exposure to extreme cold.  The resident in charge gives you medication to 
alleviate the dizziness and advises you to wear thermal underwear and avoid
further exposure to cold for the next 48 hours.

0x8304:

	You're in the hospital with the dark-haired beauty you found near
death in the maintenance department.  A team of specialists is working 
frantically to save her.  However, she seems resigned to death.

0x83ba:

	You hear the dying girl call out weakly, "I loved you all --
my sister, my teacher, my father, my life..."

0x841c:

	You're in the hospital, recovering from having your stomach pumped.
The medic assures you it was not food poisoning.  Further lab tests will
be necessary to analyze the complex poison used.

0x84cb:

	The medic ponders, "You must have some powerful enemies, or some-
one is very afraid of you and what you might discover."

0x853b:

	You are in no condition to do that now.

0x8565:

	You're in the restaurant.

0x8581:

	"Welcome to Restaurante' La Galactica, Captain Player.  Rohost,
here at your service.  Follow me, please.

0x85e3:

	You're in the restaurant.  Rohost informs you there are no seats
available.  "May I suggest you come back later, as there will be an approxi-
mately two hour delay in seating you.  Very good, sir."  Rohost rolls away.

0x86a7:

	Your steak and mushrooms are delicious.  However, just as you finish
you become violently ill.

0x8702:

	You're seated in the restaurant.  Professor Holson is sitting beside
you.  "Well, well, young man, how good to see you again.  Have you continued
our research on homotrophic spaces?  No matter, I too have left that work
behind.  I'm here studying computer programming--actually, learning program-
ming from a former student.  She's a brilliant child, or I should say a 
beautiful woman..."
	Professor Holson's description is interrupted by a loud roll of the
drums from center stage where a beautiful blond begins singing.  The Professor
excuses himself quietly, explaining he has an appointment to meet with his
protege', or rather instructor.

0x8939:

	You're in the bar.

0x894e:

	"Welcome to Spaceman's Reef Bar.  I am Rohost, your mechanical
maitre d'.  May I show you to your seat, Captain Player?  Perhaps, I should
explain.  There are two seats available at the bar.  Would you prefer to sit
beside Dr. Jack Davies or H. Ray Goode, a ship's pilot like yourself.  Don't
look so surprised, sir, part of my function as a superior peripheral of this
station's master computer is to maintain awareness of our guests' locations
via the locker keys most carry.  In the event of emergencies or messages
I am better able to serve my betters.  Your choice of seats, sir?"

0x8b54:

	"Welcome, again to Spaceman's Reef Bar.  I am sorry, sir, but there are
no seats available at the present time.  I will put your name on the waiting
list and signal when there is a seat for you.  Very good, sir."

0x8c11:

	"Welcome, again to Spaceman's Reef Bar,  Captain Player.  There is
a seat available.  This way, please."

0x8c73:

	Your drink is delicious byt seems terribly strong.  You become very
sleepy and lay your head down on the table to rest your eyes a moment.

0x8cf1:

	You awake on a bunk in the barracks with a splitting headache.

0x8d30:

	H. Ray Goode is sitting beside you in the bar.  "Greetings Captain.
I heard your ship arrived.  Repairs?  Of course, there's not much cargo to
pick up here.  My 'Wonderlust' is being repaired, but if my plans work out
I'll never sail again.  I'll be a happily married mechanic just as soon as I
can convince her to say 'yes'.  She's a beauty - tall, dark, sophisticated
and a genius.  She's a..."
	The rest of the pilot's words are lost as a loud roll of the drums
stills the crowded room.  A beautiful voice drifts forth from a beautiful
blond "...he made the green wood around him sing, he charmed the heart of
a lady..."  
	"That song is inspired," whispers the pilot.  "I think I'll go
charm the heart of my lady, if I can find Lorayne and a quiet spot in
which to propose matrimony.  Wish me luck|"

0x8ff3:

	The mechanical waiter has not yet arrived with your drink.

0x902b:

	Dr. Jack Davies is sitting beside you in the bar.  "Hello, Old
Buddy|  Long time, no see.  Seems like years ago we were on Solomaw, the
Wisdom Planet, wasn't it?  Oh|  Excuse me, allow me to introduce my newly
discovered..."
	The remainder of the doctor's speech is obscured by the roll of the
drums from center stage...A beautiful, blond guitarist steps to the stage
and begins playing and singing an ancient Earth ballad.  "...came riding 
through the woods, a-singing his song so gayly..."  As a hush falls over the
crowd, the doctor whispers.  "She's my daughter, too.  I never knew about their
birth or I'd have returned to Earth years ago."  The raven beauty, who the
doctor attempted to introduce earlier, slips quietly from the smoke-filled
room.  She is carrying a black, leather attache' case.

0x92ee:

	"...she waved goodbye forever."  The folk singer concludes her song
and begins talking to the audience.  "That song was dedicated to my father,
who claims I sing like an angel -- but what does he know?  He always loved
my sister best.  My sister and I are perfect opposites.  She's a dark
beauty and I'm the ugly, yellow twin sister -- even named for Cinderella...
This is Lucinda Davies, making music for you and accepting requests from the
audience."  The petite, young lady begins another song.

0x94a7:

	At his urging, the doctor and you follow the tall, dark and mysterious
young lady across the smoky, crowded room.  Losing her trail, you chose the
door to the inner corridor and the doctor leaves to search the outer corridor.
You arrange to meet in the doctor's office later.

0x959c:

	You're in the Doctor's Office.

0x95bf:

	The Doctor is out.  His office is empty.

0x95e9:

	The Doctor is sitting at his desk in a state of stupor.  His eyes are
vacant and glassy.  There is an ancient bottle of old Earth Scotch empty on
the floor.

0x9675:

	The doctor explains.  "I was saving this ole Scotch to toast my
retirement.  Instead I'm celebrating finding and losing two daughters -- no,
I've lost both.  Lucinda might as well be as dead as Lorayne.  Sure she did it.
What's more she made Lorayne's life miserable before she killed her.  She hated
her sweet, gentle sister almost as much as she hated me.  I only knew them a
few hours, now they're both gone..."

0x97e8:

	You awake to find yourself lying on an examination table in the
doctor's office.  Your vital signs are normal, but you have an excruciating
headache and a very tender knot on the back of your head.

0x989e:

	You are in the Library.

0x98ba:

	The Professor is here muttering to himself.  He seems to be sobbing.
He's leaning his head on his folded arms, crying on the table where he's
sitting.

0x9946:

	There are tables, chairs, a few antique books and every imaginable
type of VRT tape here.  There are also music tapes and players.

0x99bd:

	The Professor is here crying and whispering.  "We can repair them.
She knows how and she has taught me . . . We can fix them.  We can."

0x9a3b:

	You find a large manila envelope under the Professor's arm.  It is
covered with tears.

six weeks.  In the meantime, we would be glad to hold some items for you.

0x9bdf:

	You're in the barracks.

0x9bfb:

0x9cb8:

	The gymnasium is temporarily closed for repairs.

0x9ce9:

	You are in the gymnasium attempting to work off some anger and
frustration.  Ron Hershey, the talent agent is also exercising here.  He trys
to talk you into a game of racketball.  You decline tactfully.  He suggests
other combative games and becomes insulting, insisting on horseshoes or some-
thing.  You reluctantly concede to meet him in the Library later for a game
of chess.

0x9e39:

	You are in the foyer of the computer center.  A force field guards
the inner door.

oblivious to the surroundings and attempts to communicate with him are very
unsuccessful.

0xa126:

	The Professor keeps repeating, "We could've repaired them.  We could've
repaired them...."

0xa17a:

	You're in the supply room.

0xa196:

	There is a note on the door which states:  The supply officer is
on a caffeine break and will return shortly.

0xa1ff:

	The supply room is closed and locked.

0xa229:

	You pry open the supply room door and step inside.  It's very dark.
As you are looking for the light switch, something hits you over the head.
You slip to the floor in a semi-conscious state.  You can barely hear angry
voices.

0xa2f4:

	"Okay, the supplies are ordered.  Stuff those papers in your P-suit
and let's get out of here."
	"I don't have my P-suit.  It's in my locker.  Where's my key?"
	"Come on, will you?  We've got to move|"
	"Where's my key?"
	"We'll blast the locker door, like we did the attache' case.  Hustle|"
	You drift off into unconsciousness.

Theorists.  They have made this the City of Illusions and made the galaxy
nick-name us the Puzzle Planet.  Once you enter the underground, I will
not be able to offer you assistance.  I do know the one you seek is within
sight of the lake region.  Our computer technician Buker was found murdered
at the dry lake bed.

	You are standing on the landing field of Solomaw.  To the West is
the Port Authority Exchange.  To the East, the spacecraft 'Surge'.

0xd07b:

	You are in Port Authority Exchange.

0xd09e:

	You are told that the High Priest's office is directly ahead and
that you are expected.

0xd0f2:

	You're in Port Authority Exchange.

0xd115:

		All visitors are to check in with the High Priest upon
		arrival.

0xd1a1:

	You are in the office of the High Priest.

0xd1cb:

	You are in the office of the High Priest.  He is sitting in his
chair and appears to be in deep thought.

0xd22d:

	Sir, solve me riddles three and bring me the Platinum Claw, the
Silver Lance, and the Crystal Statue.  Then I'll tell you how to go
about repairing the two 8" CP/M disks.  I can do it, for I know all.
Otherwise, how would I know what you seek.  Go North from Port Authority
to find the room of directions.  There you will learn the locations of
the three riddles.

	The High Priest returns to deep thought, and it is clear that your
interview is over.

0xd3bc:

	Behind lead shielding at the edge of a radioactive wasteland is a
sector-recovery 8" CP/M disk.  Find this disk and take it, together with
your two disks to be repaired, to programmer JHH on Grand Central Space
Station.  You may find this skeleton key useful.  But beware!  Don't
try to take the key onto Grand C.

0xd4d4:

0xd50c:

	You are in the room of directions.  There is a large sign on the
Northern wall:
	There is an order to the Universe, and there is an order here.
	First, West to the Artifact Room.  Solve a riddle and return the
Platinum Claw.
	Second, North to the Museum.  Solve the riddle of the many
directions and return the Silver Lance.
	Only then should you even attempt to go East to the Maze of Death.
This way you will get to live longer.

0xd68d:

	You're in the room of directions.

0xd6b0:

	You're in a curving corridor.

0xd6d3:

	You are at the entrance to the Artifact Room.

0xd704:

	There is a nine foot tall guard that refuses to open the door for
you unless you can riddle him this:

	Three men worked all day in their Irridium Mine finding between
five and ten crystals each in an hour.  At the end of the day they were
all so tired that they decided to pitch their tent right there and wait
until morning to divide the crystals.  Soon they were all fast asleep.
But the first man had trouble sleeping.  So he quietly got up and went
outside to the crystals.  There he divided the crystals into three equal
piles except that he had one left over that he threw to a peasant.  Then
he hid his third, pushed the other two-thirds together and returned to the
tent and fell asleep.  Well, the second man had the same troubles.  He went
outside, divided the pile of crystals into thirds, had one left over which
he threw to a peasant, hid his third, pushed the other two-thirds together
and returned to the tent to fall asleep.  The third man did the same.  The
next morning the three men went outside to split up their take.  They
divided the pile into equal thirds, and there was one left over which they
threw to a peasant.  Then each took his third.  The question is: How many
Irridium crystals did the men find the previous day?

	One answer only to a customer.  A lot of guesses will not be
permitted.
